## Architecture

The library provides:
- VAD-powered audio recording
- Pluggable transcription backends
- Model management for offline operation

## Troubleshooting

**No sound recorded**
- Check System Settings ‚Üí Privacy & Security ‚Üí Microphone
- Ensure your microphone is selected as default input device

**API error (Gemini)**
- Verify your `GOOGLE_API_KEY` in `.env`
- Check your internet connection

**Whisper models not found**
- Run "Download Whisper Models" from the app menu
- Models are stored in `~/.otis-scribe-engine/models/whisper/`

**App not appearing in menu bar**
- Make sure Python has accessibility permissions
- Try running from terminal to see error messages

**VAD stops too quickly/slowly**
- VAD is configured with sensible defaults
- Custom configuration coming in future updates

## Storage & Privacy

**Temporary audio files**:
- Saved to `~/.otis-dictation-macos-app/temp/` during recording
- Automatically deleted after transcription completes
- Never uploaded or stored permanently
- If app crashes, leftover files can be safely deleted from this directory

**User settings**:
- Stored in `~/.otis-scribe-engine/config.json`
- Only contains your transcription preferences (engine choice, model size)
- No sensitive data stored
